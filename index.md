This interactive workshop addresses the many challenges and opportunities faced by research software engineers in AI-supported research software development. 
* You have not used AI tools in research software development yet, and would like to learn about possibilities and limitations?
* You are using AI tools quite extensively in your research software development, and would like to exchange knowledge and experience, as well as work towards best practices in AI-supported research software development?

Then this workshop is a great match for you! We will offer highlight talks and hands-on sessions/discussions. Stay tuned for upcoming details on the program and registration.

Your orga team - Stephan Janosch, Inga Ulusoy, Mustafa Dogan, Bernadette Fritzsch, Bela Gipp, Tuyen Le, Sebastian Nielebock
