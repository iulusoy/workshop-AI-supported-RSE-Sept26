# Workshop on AI-supported Research Software Engineering

🤖 Join us at the Workshop on AI-supported Research Software Engineering! One location, two events - just before the Collaboration Workshop!

Tuesday, 22 September 2026 - Wednesday, 23 September 2026, in Goettingen, Germany / Website: https://events.hifis.net/event/3249/page/968-workshop-on-ai-supported-research-software-engineering

This interactive workshop addresses the many challenges and opportunities faced by research software engineers in AI-supported research software development. 
* You have not used AI tools in research software development yet, and would like to learn about possibilities and limitations?
* You are using AI tools quite extensively in your research software development, and would like to exchange knowledge and experience, as well as work towards best practices in AI-supported research software development?

Then this workshop is a great match for you! We will offer highlight talks and hands-on sessions/discussions. Stay tuned for upcoming details on the program and registration.

Your orga team - Stephan Janosch, Inga Ulusoy, Mustafa Dogan, Bernadette Fritzsch, Bela Gipp, Lukas Netz, Sebastian Nielebock
