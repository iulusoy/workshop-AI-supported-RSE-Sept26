| 2 | comparing coding interfaces | compare claude code, GitHub copilot, Cursor, Antigravity, ... pros and cons, which one for what type of task, user personas | hands-on | separate, advanced | | 
| 3 | Effective use of MCPs | what is an mcp, how to connect to an mcp server, how to use the mcp server effectively, what mcp servers are available, how to set up an mcp server | hands-on | separate, advanced | | 
| 4 | Effective use of coding agents and LLMs in research software development | chat, vibe coding, user personas, what to do and what not to do, caveats | hands-on | separate, beginner | |
| 5 | How does the use of AI tools change the RSE role | code reviewer, pair programming with a chatty and always agreeing colleague, security checks, reliability and trust | all possible | joined or separate, talk or discussion, connected to 7 | | 
| 6 | Opportunities and challenges through AI-assisted research software development | more researchers write code, reproducibility and maintainability of the code, need some sort of practice guidelines for the novice to not get lost when using these tools | talk | joined, somewhat connected to 5 | | 
| 7 | AI-assisted coding in a team | how does this affect the team dynamics and deliverables, intentionality of produced code, problem-solving ability of the team  | discussion topic |
| 8 | How scientists are adopting AI coding tools? | how scientist perceive their productivity while using AI tools; research software quality as AI-generated code  | Talk | joined | | 
| 9 | Quality assurance in the age of AI - Testing | using AI to generate unit tests for edge cases; generating test suite | Hands-on | separate, beginner | | 
| 10 | Quality assurance in the age of AI - Documenting | generating documentation (e.g. docstrings, README) automatically from code for different types of users (e.g. non-tech users, developers) | Hands-on | separate, beginner | | 
| 11 | Quality assurance in the age of AI - Maintaining | can AI detect outdated libraries in our repositories and suggest reasonable changes?| Hands-on | separate, advanced | | 
| 12 | AI as a cognitive & translation tool for RSE | AI beyond coding; can AI help us understand domains better and translate science into software? Using AI to summarize unfamiliar scientific fields; How do we detect when AI's explanation is wrong? | discussion topic | joined, also talk possible | | 
| 13 | Ensuring Security in the time of AI-assisted Coding | Security Issues; OpenClaw/MCPs; Useful Policies/Procedures (e.g., virtual machines, seperate networks) | discussion topic | discussion topic or talk, could be joined or separate | | 
| 14 | RAG for different applications | how to setup RAG, AI for researchers/students | hands-on, talk | separate, both groups |
| 15 | Tool Choice for Efficiency and Persistence | providers, architectures, and automation; how to decide on what tools will be fastest today, updated tomorrow, and around in a year; when to admit added cost for added ease-of-use | Talk / discussion | separate, advanced |
